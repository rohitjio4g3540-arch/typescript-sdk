/**
 * The era-granular wire-codec layer (Q1 increment 2).
 *
 * The SDK separates a revision-neutral model layer (the public types — no
 * `resultType`, no `_meta` envelope keys, no retry fields) from per-revision
 * WIRE CODECS that own revision-exact schemas, method registries, and the
 * decode (wire → neutral lift) / encode (neutral → wire stamp) transforms.
 * The codec is a pure function of the negotiated protocol version, which is
 * ordinary connection state on the `Protocol` instance: the client stores it
 * when its handshake completes, the server stores it at `_oninitialize` (and
 * modern-era server instances get it set at instance binding by the entry).
 * There is no side table — era resolution is `codecForVersion(<instance
 * state>)`, with the pre-negotiation window covered by the outbound method
 * pins in `bootstrap.ts`.
 *
 * REQUIRED DISCLOSURE (Q1-SD1, era granularity): "the negotiated version
 * determines which types are serialized/deserialized over the wire" cashes
 * out as "the negotiated wire ERA determines them". All five legacy protocol
 * versions (2024-10-07 … 2025-11-25) share one wire vocabulary and map to the
 * single 2025-era codec — exactly how the single schema set already served
 * all five — and '2026-07-28' maps to the 2026-era codec. A new codec exists
 * only when wire vocabulary actually diverges; intra-era vocabulary is NOT
 * keyed by exact version.
 *
 * Deletions are physical: registry membership is the deletion story. The
 * 2026-era registry has no `tasks/*`, `initialize`, `ping`, `logging/setLevel`,
 * `resources/(un)subscribe` or server→client wire-request entries, so an
 * inbound era-mismatched method falls to −32601 by absence — even when a
 * handler is registered — and an outbound one dies locally with a typed
 * `SdkError` before anything reaches the transport. The 2025-era registry has
 * no `server/discover`/`subscriptions/listen`/MRTR entries, symmetrically.
 *
 * Custom-handler shadowing policy (both directions): a method that belongs to
 * the SPEC-METHOD UNIVERSE — the union of every codec's registry, derived,
 * not hand-curated — is ALWAYS era-gated, so a custom handler registered for
 * a deleted spec method (e.g. `tasks/get`) serves it only on the era that
 * defines it. Methods outside the universe are consumer-owned extension
 * methods: they are era-blind and require explicit schemas, exactly as today.
 *
 * Everything in `wire/` is internal to the bundled, `private: true` core —
 * nothing per-revision is public surface, and nothing here may ever be
 * exported from `core/public`.
